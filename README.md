PhotoView
=========

A simple ImageView that support zooming, both by Multi-touch gestures and double-tap. It is currently being used in [photup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.senab.photup).

## Features
- Out of the box Zooming.
- Allows the application to be notified when the displayed Matrix has changed. Useful for when you need to update your UI based on the current zoom/translation position.
- Allows the application to be notified when the user taps on the Photo.


## Future
There are some things I wish to add in the future:

- Allow scrolling by flinging.
- Nicer 'centering' when checking bounds.
